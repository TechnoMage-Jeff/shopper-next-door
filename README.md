# shopper-next-door

This repository was created by Team TechnoMages in the Microsoft Encode hackathon.

The goal is to develop a proof of concept that enables house-bound individuals to post a shopping list that is fulfilled by members of the community. I call the concept shopper-next-door.

The UI for the Order placer utilizes Azure Cognitive Services (speech synthesis, speech recognition and text analytics) to assemble an order.
